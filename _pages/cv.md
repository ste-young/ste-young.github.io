* B.S. in School of Telecommunication Engineering, Xidian University, Sep 2020 ~ present

  * Weighted average score in major courses: 90.4   GPA: 3.9 / 4.0

  * CET6: 570   CET4: 569   IELTS: preparing

Project experience
======
* Sep 2022 ~ prensent: Knowledge-driven Wireless Source Allocation
  * UNIC lab, Xidian University
  * Supervisor: Ruijin Sun
  * Contributions: 
     1. Engaged in extensive literature review on permutation invariance and CyberTwin, gaining profound insights into these domains.
     2. Developed the reinforcement learning environment and applied QMIX and VDN algorithms to train agents and evaluate their performance in the experiments.
     3. Introduced Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) into QMIX algorithm, and simulation results demonstrated the performance improvement brought by permutation invariance.


* Dec 2021 ~ May 2023: Intelligent Auscultation System
  * Innovation training program, leader
  * Cooperated with the First Affiliated of Xi’an Jiaotong University (from May 2023)
  * Contributions:
     1. Manually extracted MFCC and Mel spectrogram features from heart and lung sounds, classify using machine learning classifier.
     2.  Transformed raw data into Mel spectrograms, curated dataset, and employed a pre-trained VGG-16 model for accurate classification.
  * Future development: Integrate heart and lung sounds with CT imaging to achieve signal complementarity, enhancing  diagnostic capabilities and providing a comprehensive understanding of cardiovascular and respiratory health. 
  
* Mar 2023 ~ Jun 2023: Visual Media Communications
   * course desin
   * Contributions:
     1. Reimplemented classic JPEG image compression algorithm, achieving efficient image compression using C++ programming and various techniques.
     2. Implemented an image codec using ffmpeg with H.265 (HEVC) compression.
     3. Implemented network transmission of compressed video using TCP and UDP protocols.
