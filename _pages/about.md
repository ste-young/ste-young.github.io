Hello there! Welcome to my homepage! I'm thrilled to have you visit. My name is Xiao Yang, and I'm a student currently pursuing a bachelor's degree at Xidian University, set to graduate in June 2024.

With a passion for furthering my academic journey, I am eagerly looking forward to the next step in my education. My aspiration is to secure a Ph.D. position for the fall of 2024, where I can delve deeper into my chosen field of study and make meaningful contributions to the world of research and knowledge.
